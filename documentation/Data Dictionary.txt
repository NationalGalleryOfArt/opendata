National Gallery of Art Open Data Program: Collection Data in CSV Format

Introduction

Thank you for your interest in data about the National Gallery of Art’s collection.  The comma separated value files contained on this GitHub site represent a cross-section of public, fact-based data about our collection.  They contain an export of data about the NGA’s accessioned art objects, relationships between those art objects, the creators of those objects, donors who helped the NGA acquire the objects, the object’s provenance, and the public locations where the collection can be viewed, as well as links to access audio and video about the collection and people and images depicting the works. The NGA is releasing these files under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) designation.  You are free to use the data in any manner consistent with the CC0 designation. Please note that while links to media files and images contained in this data are being released under a CC0 designation, the content of the linked sites might still be copyrighted. The NGA’s Open Access Policy, for example, applies to only a subset of the images that are linked in this dataset.

The full dataset is updated frequently (usually once a day), and the date of a particular CSV file can be confirmed by examining the last commit date reported by GitHub. 

We appreciate your feedback and questions about the NGA’s open data program and are interested in learning about all the innovative ways that people are using our data, so please let us know!
The remainder of this document describes the data elements comprising the CSV formatted open dataset.

About Objects and Constituents: 

Art Objects comprise collections and are therefore one of two typical starting points for exploring a collection.  The Object Identifier, a.k.a., “objectID” is a unique sequential identifier assigned by the CMS system to each new art object registered in the collection management system.  The objectID is used to link many tables with the objects table which is the core table of the collection.

Another equally important table is the constituents table.  Similarly, a constituentID is assigned by the CMS whenever a new party is defined in the system.  The relationship table “objects_constituents” holds important metadata about the relationships between art objects and constituents and includes several types of relationships such as art object creator and donor.  

Composite Art Objects:

The structure of art objects can be somewhat complex. While many objects are comprised of a single physical part, other objects are comprised of multiple parts, with either a conceptual relationship or a physical relationship, that together make up the full cataloguing of the object.  An object like a triptych with 3 separate panels, might have 3 individual records to describe each panel, but then another record to describe the triptych as a whole.  Each panel would be related to this record as a part of the whole, but function as a separate object as well.  In the case of multiple objects records that are physically part of a single object from which they cannot be separated, like a medal or pages in a bound volume, these records would be connected with an inseparable intellectual child relationship. The child record(s) do not function independently from the physical parent record.  It is the decision of the collection management specialist to decide how best to model art objects using the various options available in the collection management system.  This document focuses primarily on a deeper description of composite objects, i.e. objects comprised of two or more art objects.
Art Object Modeling Terms:

Inseparable Intellectual Object

A single physical object with multiple intellectual parts, e.g. a coin where each side has been cataloged separately as a logical object or a book where all the pages are bound together. These objects cannot be physically separated from one another.  One part is designated the “Parent” object, and then any additional parts would be designated inseparable Intellectual Objects.  In the case of an object with drawings on both sides (recto/verso), the primary image (recto) would be designated the parent and then the secondary side (verso) would be related as an inseparable intellectual child record.
Separable Object

An object composed of multiple, separable parts, e.g. a painting that spans three panels or a sculpture consisting of two physical parts.

Cover Record

An object record that represents a set of related physical or intellectual objects, e.g. the overall book of etchings where each page is cataloged as a separate object, an inseparable intellectual child object, or a record describing the entire portfolio or series of prints, where each print is related as a separable object, or a record that describes an entire altarpiece, where each panel is related as a separable object. 

Virtual Object

An object that does not itself constitute a physical collection object, e.g. a portfolio of etchings, where there is no physical container –the cover record describes the portfolio of prints as a whole, or a case where a cover record was created for a diptych – the record describes the diptych as a whole, and the two parts are related as separable objects, however the cover record does not constitute a 3rd physical object. e.g. the cover of a book with etchings inside, a box of loose-leaf drawings, etc.   This status is recorded in the column isVirtual in the objects table.  There are currently no cases of virtual child objects.

Physical Object

An object that, in its physical entirety, is a work of art, and can function independently and separately from another object.  

Physical Object Parent

The parent object record of an intellectual child object in an inseparable relationship, e.g. head side of a coin.   Inseparable (intellectual) objects have a Physical Parent ID.  Separable (physical) objects, with which inseparable objects may be associated, do not have a Physical Parent ID (presumably because they are physical objects themselves and so do not need this distinction). The status of virtual on an object has nothing to do with physical parent object.

Inter-Object Relationships:

Direct structural relationships between art objects are contained in the table associations. When objects are related to one another, they are linked through parent-child relationships and the relationship is characterized as being either physically separable or inseparable. 

Examples:

Inseparable coins, one physical object as recto parent: http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.139898.html

Inseparable print, one physical object as recto parent:  http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.67361.html

Inseparable drawing with cover record, e.g. http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.125203.html

Inseparable portfolio with physical cover record parent, e.g. http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.76219.html

Inseparable drawing with cover record as parent, e.g. http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.143762.html

Inseparable two sided painting, physical parent (same situation as coins), e.g. http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.50724.html

Inseparable decorative art (four pieces) with one physical object chosen as parent: http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.52354.html

Separable decorative art with two pieces and one of them is physical parent: http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.53152.html 

Separable panels with one panel as physical parent: http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.2.html - left panel is parent

Separable panels currently not associated with each other: http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.282.html and http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.10.html

Separable panels with one virtual cover record parent: http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.111637.html

Separable portfolio with virtual cover record parent: http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.71729.html - parent should probably be virtual but is marked as physical

Separable portfolio with physical cover record parent: http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.95381.html - example where cover can be considered a work itself

Separable portfolio with virtual cover record parent: http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.163596.html

Separable drawing with virtual cover record parent: http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.141579.html

Separable sculpture with physical cover record parent: http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.130750.html - each side cataloged as separate object

Separable volume with physical cover record parent: http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.58003.html

If an image copyright exists, it must always be displayed with each image of the object

There can be multiple images per object 

The begin and end dates are provided to facilitate returning the object via search, but they are no foolproof.  For example, when the displayDate is unset, usually the begin and end dates are the artist’s life dates since that’s the best information available.

    maxpixels           integer,				A limitation used to enforce fair use doctrine.  When the width and height are larger than the max pixels setting, the image server will only permit sourcing of IIIF services from an image resized to fit within a box of this dimension.  A customer might request a larger image to be produced via IIIF, but the resulting image will blur as the size increases since the source image size is restricted.
    created             timestamp with time zone,	Indicates the creation date of the actual source image uploaded to the NGA’s digital asset management system
    modified            timestamp with time zone,	Indicates the modification date of the image metadata record in the digital asset management system – dates tend to be more recent due to automated updates to metadata
